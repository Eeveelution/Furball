Win32 arm64 is not officially supported in Bass
see:
https://www.un4seen.com/forum/?topic=19471.msg136146#msg136146

*however* there are test builds of both Bass and BassFX for arm64! 
So this means we *can* run on arm64! woohoo!

Our usage of Bass and BassFX is very very basic, so there should be no problem with a >1yo build
(also bass_fx and bass are version mismatched but im sure its fiine)
